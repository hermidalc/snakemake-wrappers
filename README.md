# snakemake-wrappers

Snakemake modular reusable tool wrappers for use in analysis workflows.

I have my own repository of Snakemake wrappers instead of using the community
[Snakemake wrapper repository](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-wrappers),
because I found some of the community wrappers are missing general or custom
functionality I needed, or I wanted to design the wrapper differently, so
instead of forking it and making a lot of changes I have my own wrappers that
anyone can use from here.
